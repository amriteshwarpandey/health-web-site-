                <strong>Myth 1:</strong> Lifting weights makes you bulky.
                <div class="answer" id="answer1">
                    <p>Truth: Women, in particular, don't have the same levels of testosterone as men, which makes it harder to gain muscle mass quickly. Weight training helps to build lean muscle, improve metabolism, and strengthen bones without necessarily making you bulky.</p>

            <div class="myth-card" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2')">
                <strong>Myth 2:</strong> You need to drink 8 glasses of water a day.
                <div class="answer" id="answer2">
                    <p>Truth: Hydration needs vary by individual. Factors such as age, gender, climate, and physical activity all influence how much water you need. Instead of counting glasses, listen to your body’s thirst signals and monitor the color of your urine.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="myth-card" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3')">
                <strong>Myth 3:</strong> Carrots improve your eyesight.
                <div class="answer" id="answer3">
                    <p>Truth: While carrots are rich in beta-carotene, which is beneficial for eye health, they do not directly improve eyesight. A balanced diet including a variety of nutrients is essential for maintaining good vision and overall eye health.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-card" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer4')">
                <strong>Myth 4:</strong> Eating fat makes you fat.
                <div class="answer" id="answer4">
                    <p>Truth: Not all fats are created equal. Healthy fats, such as those found in avocados, nuts, and olive oil, are essential for your body to function properly. They can help you feel full, support cell growth, and reduce inflammation without leading to weight gain when consumed in moderation.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-card" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer5')">
                <strong>Myth 5:</strong> You can't build muscle if you're over 50.
                <div class="answer" id="answer5">
                    <p>Truth: Muscle building is possible at any age with the right exercise regimen and proper nutrition. Resistance training is particularly effective for older adults, helping to increase muscle mass, improve bone density, and enhance overall functional abilities.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-card" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer6')">
                <strong>Myth 6:</strong> You must exercise every day to see results.
                <div class="answer" id="answer6">
                    <p>Truth: Rest days are crucial for recovery and muscle growth. Overtraining can lead to injuries and burnout. A balanced exercise routine with adequate rest days is more sustainable and effective for long-term fitness progress.</p>

            <div class="myth-card" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer7')">
                <strong>Myth 7:</strong> More sweat means a better workout.
                <div class="answer" id="answer7">
                    <p>Truth: Sweat is your body’s way of cooling itself and doesn’t necessarily correlate with workout intensity. Factors like temperature, humidity, and individual sweat rates can influence how much you sweat. Focus on how you feel and your performance metrics instead.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-card" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer8')">
                <strong>Myth 8:</strong> Crunches are the best way to get a six-pack.
                <div class="answer" id="answer8">
                    <p>Truth: Crunches alone won't give you a six-pack. A combination of a healthy diet, cardiovascular exercises, and full-body strength training is more effective in reducing body fat and toning your abs. Core workouts should also include a variety of exercises targeting different muscle groups.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-card" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer9')">
                <strong>Myth 9:</strong> You can target fat loss in specific areas.
                <div class="answer" id="answer9">
                    <p>Truth: Spot reduction is a myth. You cannot control where your body loses fat. Fat loss occurs evenly throughout the body through a combination of a healthy diet, regular cardio, and strength training exercises.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-card" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer10')">
                <strong>Myth 10:</strong> More protein always means more muscle.
                <div class="answer" id="answer10">
                    <p>Truth: While protein is essential for muscle repair and growth, there's a limit to how much your body can utilize. Consuming excessive protein won't necessarily lead to more muscle gain and can strain the kidneys. Balanced nutrition, along with proper workout routines, is key.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-card" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer11')">
                <strong>Myth 11:</strong> Cardio is the only way to lose weight.
                <div class="answer" id="answer11">
                    <p>Truth: Both cardio and strength training are important for weight loss. Building muscle through resistance training increases your metabolism, helping you burn more calories even at rest.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-card" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer12')">
                <strong>Myth 12:</strong> You have to eat immediately after a workout.
                <div class="answer" id="answer12">
                    <p>Truth: While eating protein and carbohydrates after a workout helps with recovery, you don't have to do it immediately. A balanced meal within two hours of exercising is usually sufficient.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-card" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer13')">
                <strong>Myth 13:</strong> Detox diets cleanse your body.
                <div class="answer" id="answer13">
                    <p>Truth: Your liver and kidneys naturally detoxify your body. Detox diets and cleanses are often unnecessary and can sometimes be harmful. Focus on a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and water.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-card" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer14')">
                <strong>Myth 14:</strong> Stretching before exercise is necessary.
                <div class="answer" id="answer14">
                    <p>Truth: While stretching can be beneficial, it's more effective to do dynamic warm-ups before exercise. Save static stretching for after your workout to help with recovery and flexibility.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-card" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer15')">

                <div class="answer" id="answer15">
                    <p>Truth: While natural sugars found in fruits come with beneficial nutrients and fiber, excessive consumption of any sugar can be harmful. Moderation is key to maintaining a healthy diet.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-card" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer16')">

                <div class="answer" id="answer16">
                    <p>Truth: A well-planned plant-based diet can provide all essential amino acids and sufficient protein through a variety of sources like beans, lentils, tofu, and quinoa.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-card" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer17')">
                <strong>Myth 17:</strong> You should avoid eating before bed.
                <div class="answer" id="answer17">
                    <p>Truth: Eating before bed isn't necessarily bad and can be beneficial if you're hungry. Choose light, healthy snacks like a piece of fruit, yogurt, or a small serving of nuts to avoid negative impacts on your sleep and digestion.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="answer" id="answer18">
                    <p>Truth: Muscle and fat are different tissues; one does not transform into the other. If you stop exercising, you may lose muscle mass and gain fat due to changes in activity levels and diet.</p>

                    <p>Truth: Low-fat or fat-free products often contain added sugars or other ingredients to improve taste. Always check the nutrition label. Whole foods with natural fats can be a healthier option.</p>
